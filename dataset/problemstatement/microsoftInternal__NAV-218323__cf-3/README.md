# Title: "Journal Template Name must have a value" error message appears if you try to Calculate and Post VAT Settlement and Journal Template Name Mandatory is enabled in the G/L Setup.
## Repro Steps:
1.Go to G/L Setup.
2.Settings -> Design -> Add Journal Template Name Mandatory and enable it.
3.Search for Calculate and Post Vat Settlement.
4.Add any dates for:
  a. Ending Date
  b. Posting Date.
  c. Add Settlement Account.
  d. Enable Post.
5.After Preview, an error should occur for Vendor.
6.If you disable the Journal Template Name Mandatory, It works fine.

We guess a kind of control should be set in this scenario, so this check is not executed only for Customer entries.
If there is anything we are missing, please let us know what.
Thanks!
