## Description:
PROBLEM:
==============
When Default Qty to Ship on Sales & Receivable Setup is change to Blank, Item Charge cannot be brought into a Sales Return Order. The error message suggests that without the automatic calculation of Invoice, the system does not know what invoice to assign to Item Charge, and thus it cannot bring it in.

However if you change Default Qty to Ship. To Remainder, it is called in fine.

EXPECTATION:
==============
Item Charge should be successfully called in to reverse

RESULT:
==============
Error message pops up

Do note however, that the Default Qty to ship flavor text states that qty to invoice is not automatically calculated when set to blank, which might be why item charge does not get called in. Customer wants item charge to be called in even when it is set to blank. Is this a limitation or by-design, which would require them to raise an IDEA, or a BUG?

Default Quantity to Ship
Specifies the default value for the Qty. to Ship field on sales order lines and the Return Qty. to Receive field on sales return order lines. If you choose Blank, the quantity to invoice is not automatically calculated.
