# Title: Field Email on Reminder is empty when customer does not have any contacts
## Repro Steps:
Tested in latest build 26.x onprem
1.Create a new domestic customer that has no contact, use the template CUSTOMER PERSON
In addition to the automatically added fields, add the following values:
Address: Test
City: Birmingham
Post Code: B27 4KT
Email: test@test.de
Payment Terms Code: 7 Days
Reminder Terms Code: Domestic
2.Then create and post a new Sales Invoice for this customer
Posting Date = 01/01/27
1x item 1896-S
3.Go to the reminders and create a new reminder with button "Create Reminders"
Posting Date = 01/31/27
Document Date = 01/31/27
4.A new reminder should now be created for our new customer. Open that reminder

**Actual Result:**
The field email on the reminder header is empty

**Expected Result:**
The email field should show value test@test.de

**Additional Information:**
Usually the email field on the reminder header does show the email of the contact related to the customer. In our case the contact email is empty, so the email from the customer card should be shown. When you then actually issue and send the reminder, you will notice that BC does take the e-mail adress from the customer card.
But this e-mail adress should also be visible on the reminder page directly.
