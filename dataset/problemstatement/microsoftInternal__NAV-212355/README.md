Title: Input quantity and related production time is not recalculated in a released production order when using the function "Replan"
Repro Steps:
1.  Open BC 25.4 W1 on prem
2.  Go to "Routing", create a new routing
    Type = serial
    Work Center: 100
    Setup Time: 10 
    Run Time: 10
    Status: Certified
    ![Routing Step2](./routing_step2.png)
3.  Go to Production BOMs and create a new one.
    Unit of Measure Code: PCS
    Item: 70000
    Quantity per: 10
    Status: Certified
    ![Production BOMs Step3](./Production_BOMs_step3.png)
4.  Go to Items Create a new item (70062)
    Use Template: ITEM
    Replenishment System = Prod. Order
    Manufacturing Policy = Make-to-Stock
    Routing = R00010 (Created in step 2)
    Production BOM No. = P00010 (Created in step 3)
    Reordering policy = Empty
    Reserve = Optional
    Order Tracking policy = None
5.  Go to "Released Production order" - Create a new one
    Source type = item
    Source No. = Created item in step 4 (70061)
    Quantity = 50
    Due date = 28/1/2027
    ->Refresh Production Order
    Note that the "starting date-time" on the line is "26/01/2027" while the "ending date-time" is "27/01/2027"

6.  Open the Production journal
    Line  Production Journal
    Post an output of 20
    And a consumption of 200
    Setup Time: 10
    Run Time: 10
    ![Production Journal Step6](./production_journal_step6.png)
    Post
7.  Go back to the "Released Production Order", note that you now have 20 finished quantities.
    ![Released Production Order Step7](./Released_Production_Order_step7.png)
8.  Without using the replan function, the input quantity is expected to remain the same and the "Starting date-time" should also be same.
    Check the input quantity, for the "Routing" Line -> Routing
    Add the field Input Quantity with the Design functionality:
    ![Prod Order Routing Step8](./prod_order_routing_step8.png)
    Back in the production Order - > Replan the production order
    Home -> Replan
    ![Replan Production Order Step8](./replan_production_order_step8.png)

    ACTUAL RESULT:
    Nothin happened

    EXPECTED RESULT:
    The Starting Time should be recalculated based on the Remaining Quantity
    ![101005test Result](./101005test_result.png)
    And the Input Quantity should be reduced to the Remaining Quantity:

    According to the documentation [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders), looking through, it states that when you select "Plan" as "No Level", it should only update the item schedule, this includes the starting date-time and ending date-time.
    ![Result in Additional Information](./result_in_Additional_information.png)
    With the present design, if a new routing line or component line is added, it will keep the original quantity instead of taking the remaining quantity.

    ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
    I tested in BC 16.5 there the results are as expected:

Description:
Input quantity and related production time is not recalculated in a released production order when using the function "Replan". In Version BC16.5 did it work as expected.
