# Title: The service order header status field is not being validated properly when new line is added
## Repro Steps:
1. Insert a standard item into the service order line
2. Add it to the line, update the status to 'Finished', and then insert a new line
3. The new service item with a status of 'Pending', but the service order header status remains 'Finished'
4. But if I re-validate the Pending status field on my service line, the header status changes.

Actual Result: The service order header status field is not being validated properly
Expected Result: The expected behavior is that the header status should reflect the priority status only after the service item line is committed.

## Description:
The service order header status field is not being validated properly when new line is added. The header status should update only after the service item line record has been committed (Modify), ensuring proper execution ordering.
