Title: Manually change quantity of "Take Line" in Warehouse Pick changes the quantity of the Wrong "Place Lines"
Repro Steps:
SETUP
1.Location Card in DK Localization, require Pick = yes and Prod. Consumtion Whse. Handling = Warehouse Pick (mandatory) (The rest does not need to be filled)
![Location Card Setup1](./location_card_setup1.png)
Set up the Production Bins
![Production Bins Setup1](./production_bins_setup1.png)
2.Setup yourself as the Warehouse Employee

3.I have the Item that I want to manufacture (1000)
4.Replenishment is Prod. Order, and I have attached a BOM.
![Item Card Setup4](./item_card_setup4.png)
5.Only one Item in the BOM (Item should be different Item, NOT same item as being made...should be **COMPONENT** Item  >>  Note this from DP Repro Steps)
![Production Bom](./production_bom.png)
6.The Item in the BOM has replenishment Purchase, Allow Whse. Overpick is true and then Flushing Method is Pick + Manual (Again, this is different item, NOT 1000...should be **COMPONENT** Item)
![Item Card Setup6](./item_card_setup6.png)
7.Navigate to Item Journals, for the **COMPONENT** Item, Create 5 lines, 900 quantities from Bin S-01-01 to S-01-05 (Everything would total 4500 qty)
![Item Journals Setup7](./item_journals_setup7.png)
8.Post the Journal

Repro
1.Create a Released Prod Order for the Item created in step 3 (Item to be manufactured) above, quantity is 4200, Location is Silver then Refresh the Order.
![Released Production Order](./released_production_order.png)
2.Create Warehouse Pick once the Prod Order Line is populated
![Create Warehouse Pick](./create_warehouse_pick.png)
3.Navigate to the Warehouse Pick created
![Released Production Order Repro3](./released_production_order_repro3.png)
![Warehouse Pick Lines](./warehouse_pick_lines.png)
4.on Last Take Line for Example, change the Quantity to take from 900 to 400

**Expected Result**
The Last Place line would be updated to 400

**Actual result**
The Second Place Line is updated instead which is confusing

The Partner mentioned that the in the Code there seems to be a filter that always updates the First line of the Placing
