EXTRA INFO FROM PARTNER

Debugging function CreateNotificationEntry - Codeunit 1521
![Local procedure CreateNotificationEntry](./local-procedure-createnotificationentry.png)

This function calls function CreateNotificationEntry from “Notification entry” Table, and in its definition is expecting to receive the following parameters:

![Public procedure CreateNotificationEntry](./public-procedure-createnotificationentry.png)

The second parameter expects to receive Userid (Code 50) and here is where the problem is as to get the UserID it calls the GetNotificationUserID, with a register that should come from "Approval Entry". Field 6 of "Approval Entry" table is Sender ID, which is Code 50. But, we have checked that on this point in some situations we find a register of "Sales Header"... Field 6 of "Sales Header" is Bill-to Name 2... Text 50...
GetNotificationUserID exit this Text50 and the error happens.

This is the exact point in the code where the error happens:

![Debug procedure](./debug-procedure.png)

The function try to exit the "Sender ID" and as we saw already this is field 6 of "Approval Entry" table and in "Sales Header" it doe snot exist... and exit the "Bill-to Name 2" field...which is field 6 of "Sales Header" table.

## Description:
When you request approval of a Purchase Quote with Notify Sender activated, we shall receive such error message: "The definition of the Pay-to Name 2 field has changed; old type: Code, new type: Text. Start your activity again."
