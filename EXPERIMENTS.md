# Running Experiments

This guide covers how to run BC-Bench evaluations with different configurations.

## Quick Start

To setup your local environment, follow [Setup](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

## Workflow Tips

### Check for Running Workflows

Before queueing a new run, check if there's already one running:

```bash
# List running workflows for Copilot
gh run list --workflow=copilot-evaluation --status=in_progress
```

Avoid queueing multiple full evaluations simultaneously - they compete for resources and can cause timeouts.

## Experimenting with GitHub Copilot CLI

By default, Copilot CLI runs with `--no-custom-instructions` and no MCP Servers (`--disable-builtin-mcps`).

Steps for an experiment:
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b experiment/<meaningful-name>`
2. Edit `src/bcbench/agent/shared/config.yaml` and optionally modify instruction markdown under `src/bcbench/agent/copilot/instructions/<sanitized-repo>/` (see below)
3. Locally run one entry: `uv run bcbench run copilot <entry_id>` to ensure everything is setup correctly
4. Create a draft PR (the default template will let you switch to the experiment template)
5. In GitHub Actions: run workflow `copilot-evaluation` after selecting your branch & model
6. Start with **Test Run** (2 entries) → verify the changes are picked up in logs
7. Run full evaluation

> Test runs are faster (~1h) and help confirm MCP reachability & instruction copying before a longer full run.

### MCP Servers

Uncomment the `mcp:` section in [config.yaml](src/bcbench/agent/shared/config.yaml), and replace the example MCP Servers with yours:

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: "mslearn"
      type: "http"
      url: "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp"
      tools: ["*"]
```

### Custom Instructions

Enable instruction in the [config.yaml](src/bcbench/agent/shared/config.yaml):

```yaml
instructions:
  enabled: true
```

Replace the files below with your instructions:
```
src/bcbench/agent/copilot/instructions/microsoftInternal-NAV/
  copilot-instructions.md
  instructions/
    tables.instructions.md
    pages.instructions.md
    codeunits.instructions.md
```

How it works (take `NAV` repo as example):
1. Repo name (`microsoftInternal/NAV`) is sanitized to `microsoftInternal-NAV`
2. All files under `microsoftInternal-NAV` will be copied into `NAV/.github/` (overwrite if exists)
3. If `enabled: false`, a `--no-custom-instructions` flag is passed instead.

### Skills

Enable skills in the [config.yaml](src/bcbench/agent/shared/config.yaml):

```yaml
skills:
  enabled: true
```

Replace the folder and files below with your skills:
```
src/bcbench/agent/copilot/instructions/microsoftInternal-NAV/
  skills/
    al-test-generation/
      SKILL.md
```

How it works (take `NAV` repo as example):
1. Repo name (`microsoftInternal/NAV`) is sanitized to `microsoftInternal-NAV`
2. The `skills/` folder is copied to `NAV/.github/skills/` (replaces existing skills directory)
3. If `enabled: false`, skills are simply not copied (Copilot auto-discovers from `.github/skills/`)

### Custom Agents

Enable instruction in the [config.yaml](src/bcbench/agent/shared/config.yaml):

```yaml
# controls:
# 1. whether to copy custom agents (`src/bcbench/agent/copilot/instructions/<sanitized-repo>/agents/`) into the repo
# 2. whether to pass --agent=<agent-name> to copilot
agents:
  enabled: true
  name: ALTest
```

## Results & Metrics

You can find all results in the GitHub Action (workflow: `copilot-evaluation`) directly:
- Logs: select one instance, find the step called `Run GitHub Copilot CLI ...`, and see how copilot solve an issue
- Artifacts:
  - per-entry result JSONL (with all metrics)
  - Copilot CLI logs

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if some jobs fail?

It is normal to have some instabilities, inspect the failure messages to determine if it's indeed an instability. If so, simply re-queue the failed jobs; if not, implement the fix and you will have to trigger a brand new run afterwards.

### My runs have successfully finished, what now?

If you would like to display your results on the GitHub Page, you should be able to find a newly created branch as a result of the workflow run. Use that branch to create a Pull Request and make sure everything is correct, merge that Pull Request and you should be able to see it on GitHub Page after a few minutes.

If the created branch has merge conflict, this is very common. You will need to manually resolve the conflict by appending the latest runs (ignore the aggregate). The aggregate can be manually re-calculated by running `uv run bcbench result refresh`.
